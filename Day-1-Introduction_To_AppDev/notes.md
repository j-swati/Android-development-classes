**Application** - software program designed to perform specific tasks

**Web application -** software program that runs on a web server & can be accesses through a web browser over internet

**Mobile Application -** software program designed to run on mobile devices

**Frontend**

- Frontend/client-side of an application is the part that users interact with directly
- It includes everything the user experiences, such as the layout, design & interactivity

Backend

- Backend / server-side of an application is responsible for the logic, database interactions, user authentication, & server configurations

**UI (User Interface)**

- Point of interaction between the user & computer application
- It includes all the visual elements like buttons, menus, icons & other graphical components that enable users to interact with the app.

**Framework**

- A standardised set of tools, libraries & best practices that provides a foundation for developing applications.
- It helps streamline the development process by providing pre-built components & structure

**Different frontend Frameworks → React | Angular | Vue.js**
**Different backend Frameworks → Express.js | Django | Ruby on Rails**

**Backend services**

- Refer to server side operations & processes that support an application
- Databse management | User authentication | data processing | integration with other services

**API (Application Programming Interfae)**

- set of rules & protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other
- defines the methods & data formats that applications can use to request & exchange information

**JSON (Javascript Object Notation)**

- lightweight data format for sharing data that is easy  for humans to read & write and easy for machines to parse & generate
- often used to send data between server and a web application

**Status Code**

- tells us how the request went

**Authentication Token**

- piece of data that is used to verify the identity of a user or a process
- used to login & stay logged in to an application

**Scalable Systems -** 

- are designed to handle increased load without compromising performance
- scalability can refer to the ability of  a system to handle more users, more data, or more transactions by adding resources like additional servers.
