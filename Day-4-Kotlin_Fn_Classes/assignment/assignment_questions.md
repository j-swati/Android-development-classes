1. **Function Overloading:**
Define two overloaded functions named calculateArea that calculate the area
of a rectangle and a circle. The first function should take two parameters (length
and breadth) and return the area of a rectangle. The second function should take
one parameter (radius) and return the area of a circle.
1. **Higher-Order Functions:**
Write a higher-order function named operation that takes two integers and a
function as parameters. The function should apply the given function to the two
integers and return the result.
1. **Extension Functions:**
Create an extension function for the String class named isPalindrome that
returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
1. **Recursive Functions:**
Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Optimize the
function to avoid stack overflow for large inputs.
Advanced Programming Questions on Classes
1. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area. Create two
subclasses Rectangle and Circle that implement the area method. Add
another method perimeter in both subclasses and demonstrate polymorphism.
1. **Data Classes and Copy Function:**
Define a data class Person with properties name, age, and address. Create an
instance of Person and use the copy function to create a new instance with a
different age and address.
1. **Companion Objects and Factory Methods:**
Create a class User with a companion object that has a factory method to create
a user with a default age. Extend the factory method to allow creation of a user
with optional parameters for name and age.
1. **Interface Implementation:**
Create an interface Drawable with a method draw. Implement this interface in
two classes Square and Triangle. Extend the interface to include a method
resize and demonstrate its usage in both classes.
1. **Singleton Pattern:**
Implement the Singleton pattern using Kotlin's object declaration. Create a class
DatabaseConnection that ensures only one instance of the connection exists
throughout the application
